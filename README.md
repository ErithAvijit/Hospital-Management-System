# Hospital-Management-System
4. Suppose we design a hospital management system with the following facilities:
1. Add the patient details with the necessary information.
2. Search for patient information.
3. Update patient information.
4. Allocate a bed with the required details
5. Maintained a log book for different tests and medicine
6. Generate a discharge summary at the time of discharge.
7. Create a biller module to calculate daily bills.
8. Constraints: Total number of beds are limited.
  Now, the hospital management system should be designed with the appropriate data structure
  so that someone can use this system to maintain the hospital database.
